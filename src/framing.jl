    FrameReader(stream, max_receive_message_length[, request_encoding])

Pull-based decoder of the gRPC length-prefixed framing over an `IO` request
body (in the server, an `HTTP.Stream`).

`request_encoding` is the value of the request's `grpc-encoding` header, or
`nothing` (the default) when the client sent none; it enables decompression of
frames whose compressed flag is set. Messages are rejected with
`UNIMPLEMENTED` when a compressed frame arrives with no header or an
unsupported codec, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` when the decompressed payload exceeds
`max_receive_message_length`, and `INTERNAL` when the compressed data is
corrupt.

A single growable `buf` holds the bytes pulled from the stream. `r` is the read
offset (bytes `1:r` have been consumed) and `w` is the write offset (bytes
`1:w` are valid). Stream bytes are read straight into the free tail of `buf`,
and `read_message!` returns a view into `buf` rather than a copy, so a received
message is not copied on its way to the decoder.

Return the next fully-framed message as an `IOBuffer` positioned at the start,

`GRPCError` on a compressed frame with no usable codec (`UNIMPLEMENTED`), an
oversize length prefix (`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`), a truncated frame
(`INVALID_ARGUMENT`), an oversize decompressed payload (`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`)

The returned `IOBuffer` borrows the reader's internal storage. It is only valid
until the next `read_message!` call (which may grow, compact, or reallocate that
storage), so it must be fully decoded before reading the following message. All
callers in this package decode immediately, which preserves that invariant.
Exception: when the frame's compressed flag is set and a non-identity codec was
negotiated, the payload is decompressed into a fresh buffer (one allocation,
inherent to decompression) and the returned buffer borrows that instead.
