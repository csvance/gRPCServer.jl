# nghttp2 backend adapter, loaded only when Nghttp2Wrapper.jl is present.

# Nghttp2Wrapper's server handler is buffered: it receives a complete
# ServerRequest and returns a complete ServerResponse. That is enough for RPCs
# whose response is a single message — unary and client-streaming — because all
# request messages are already in hand and the one response is emitted at the
# end.
#
# It is NOT enough for server-streaming or bidirectional calls, which need
# messages delivered as they are produced. Those are refused explicitly here
# rather than served with wrong timing: bidirectional request/response exchanges
# (server reflection, for one) would deadlock, since the peer waits for a reply
# that is only flushed once the handler returns.

Walk the next length-prefixed message out of the fully-buffered request body.

!!! warning "What the receive cap bounds on this backend"
    `max_receive_message_length` is enforced here, so a handler never sees a
    message larger than the configured cap and an oversize one is refused with
    `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, as on the other backends. But Nghttp2Wrapper's handler
    is **buffered**: the whole request body is already in memory before this
    function is ever called. The cap therefore bounds what the server *processes*,
    not what it *allocates* — unlike `HTTPjlBackend` and `PureHTTP2Backend`,
    where the prefix is refused before the payload is read off the socket.

    Bounding the allocation itself needs a body-size limit in Nghttp2Wrapper,
    which it does not currently offer. This is the reason `Nghttp2Backend` is not
    recommended for untrusted peers.
