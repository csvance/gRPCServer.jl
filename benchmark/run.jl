# Large-protobuf throughput / allocation benchmark for gRPCServer.jl.
#
# Run standalone (not part of the test suite):
#
#   julia --project=benchmark -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'   # first time
#   julia --project=benchmark --threads=auto benchmark/run.jl
#
# Scale with GRPC_BENCH_N (end-to-end iteration count) and GRPC_BENCH_BIG
# (large-payload element count). The benchmark starts an in-process h2c server
# and drives it with gRPCClient. Because client and server share one process,
# the reported allocations cover the whole round trip; treat them as a relative
# before/after measure of the framing and encode paths, not an absolute figure.
