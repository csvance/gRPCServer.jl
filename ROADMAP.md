# Roadmap

This document outlines planned improvements and missing features for gRPCServer.jl based on the project constitution requirements.

## Open Questions

### Streaming interop coverage on the LTS

**Status**: Blocked upstream, waiting on a release

Our interop suite gates every streaming test behind `VERSION >= v"1.12"`, in
`test/integration/test_grpcclient.jl` and
`test/integration/grpcclient/client_stubs.jl`. The consequence is easy to
overlook and worth stating plainly: **on the Julia 1.10 job, the server-streaming,
client-streaming and bidirectional paths are exercised against no real client at
all.** Only unary, error propagation, compression and the sustained-call
regression run there.

The gate is not ours by choice. gRPCClient 1.0.4 compiles `Streaming.jl` out
below 1.12 (`@static if VERSION >= v"1.12"`, warning citing
[gRPCClient#68](https://github.com/JuliaIO/gRPCClient.jl/issues/68)).

[gRPCClient#129](https://github.com/JuliaIO/gRPCClient.jl/pull/129) traces that
to **two libcurl bugs rather than a Julia one**: `select_bits_paused` ORs the two
directions in libcurl 8.4.0–8.5.0, so a paused upload also stops the download —
which is what Julia 1.10 bundles; and 8.6.0 clobbers a transfer's pending read
interest, which is what hits 1.11. Demonstrated by swapping only libcurl under an
unchanged Julia 1.10: the suite goes from 5m12s with errors on 8.4.0 to passing
in 12s on 8.15.0. Server streaming is unaffected either way, since it never
pauses the upload.

**Nothing here is a defect in this package.** The two client-visible faults we
found and fixed were ours and were proven server-side — the undrained request
body causing spurious `RST_STREAM(CANCEL)`, and the >64 KB truncation from
`Base.read` returning short.

**When gRPCClient 1.1.0 is released** (General currently has 1.0.4; 1.1.0-rc1
exists but a prerelease is not selected by our `gRPCClient = "1"` bound):

- [ ] Drop both `@static if VERSION >= v"1.12"` guards
- [ ] Raise the `gRPCClient` compat bound to the release that carries the fix
- [ ] Confirm the streaming interop tests pass on the 1.10 job

**Worth re-measuring at the same time**, without over-reading it: `remote_harness.jl`
runs the test server out-of-process because a colocated client measured 0/24.
Those failures were unary and the libcurl wedge is described for
request-streaming, so the two are probably unrelated — but "the caller blocks
until its deadline" is exactly the symptom our 120s `_warmup` was built around.
If it turns out to have been this, the harness can be simplified.

### Large request bodies on `PureHTTP2Backend`

**Status**: Open — upstream, tracked in PureHTTP2.jl.

A unary request whose body exceeds the HTTP/2 initial flow-control window
(65535 bytes) never reaches the handler on `PureHTTP2Backend`: the stream is
reset. `HTTPjlBackend`, the default, is unaffected — its own version of this
limit was fixed in 0.2.0. `PureHTTP2Backend` is the opt-in backend, selected
explicitly via `http2_backend=PureHTTP2Backend()`.

The cause is in PureHTTP2.jl's connection layer, not here. See its ROADMAP for
the seven hypotheses measured and eliminated. Nothing to do in this repository
beyond widening the `PureHTTP2` compat bound once a fixed version is released.

### A third backend via Nghttp2Wrapper.jl

**Status**: ✅ Complete — shipped as a weak-dep package extension.

`Nghttp2Backend` is implemented as a package extension
(`[weakdeps]` + `[extensions]` in `Project.toml`; `ext/gRPCServerNghttp2Ext.jl`),
CI-tested via the dedicated `nghttp2` job (`.github/workflows/CI.yml`), and
serves unary and client-streaming calls. Nghttp2Wrapper's fully-buffered
handler cannot time server- or bidirectional streaming, so those are refused
with an explicit `UNIMPLEMENTED` reply rather than served with wrong timing.

The backend type is declared in the main package with a capability guard that
fails fast when the extension is not loaded (`_assert_nghttp2_capable`),
mirroring `HTTPjlBackend`'s `_assert_httpjl_capable`.

**Historical note**: the original prerequisite assessment (2026-07-30) judged
this "premature — two gaps upstream" (`Nghttp2Wrapper` had no trailer support
and a fully-buffered handler model). The shipped design resolves the trailer gap
by accumulating trailers and delivering them with the final `ServerResponse`;
the buffered-handler timing limitation remains and is documented on the HTTP/2
Backends page.

### Residual: `wait_for_message_or_end` discards response frames

**Status**: Open — small, isolated.

`wait_for_message_or_end` calls `process_frame` and drops the frames it
returns, where the main connection loop writes them back. That is wrong on its
own terms — those frames include flow-control updates. Measured *not* to be the
cause of the large-request failure above, which is why it was never committed.

## High Priority

### Server Streaming RPC Support with grpcurl

**Status**: Complete

Server streaming RPC methods now work correctly via grpcurl.

**Completed**:
- [x] Implement server streaming support in HTTP/2 response handling
- [x] Test with 02_hello_stream SayHelloStream example
- [x] Update examples/02_hello_stream/README.md with streaming grpcurl commands

### gRPCClient.jl Integration Tests

**Status**: Complete

Integration tests against [gRPCClient.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/gRPCClient.jl) validate client-server interoperability within the Julia gRPC ecosystem.

**Completed**:
- [x] Add gRPCClient.jl as a test dependency
- [x] Create `test/integration/test_grpcclient.jl`
- [x] Test all RPC patterns (unary, server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional)
- [x] Test error handling and status code propagation
- [x] Test compression negotiation

**Notes**:
- Streaming tests (server, client, bidi) are gated on Julia >= 1.12 — not because
  of Julia, but because of libcurl; see *Streaming interop coverage on the LTS*
  under Open Questions
- Unary and error tests run on all Julia versions (1.10+)
- Fixed HTTP/2 ENABLE_PUSH compliance (RFC 9113) discovered during testing
- Metadata/header passing tests deferred to a follow-up

### Full mTLS Client Verification

**Status**: ✅ Complete (via Reseau.jl)

Delivered in feature 018-reseau-tls-alpn by switching the TLS backend from OpenSSL.jl to [Reseau.jl](https://github.com/JuliaServices/Reseau.jl). The OpenSSL.jl upstream work originally planned (contributing `SSL_CTX_set_verify` bindings) is no longer needed — Reseau.jl exposes the required verification primitives via its `ClientAuthMode` path.

**Completed**:
- [x] Real server-side ALPN selection during the TLS handshake (`SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb`), with the negotiated protocol read back via `SSL_get0_alpn_selected` instead of inferred
- [x] mTLS client certificate verification actually enforced when `require_client_cert = true`, via Reseau's `ClientAuthMode`
- [x] Atomic `reload_tls!` that swaps the active TLS configuration without rebinding the listening socket or dropping in-flight handshakes
- [x] Handshake failures classified per `TLSHandshakeFailureKind` (CONFIG_ERROR, ALPN_MISMATCH, PEER_CERT_REJECTED, HANDSHAKE_IO_ERROR) with distinguishable log lines
- [x] New `docs/src/tls.md` operator walkthrough
- [x] New `test/integration/test_tls_interop.jl` exercising the listener against Reseau.TLS, `openssl s_client`, and `grpcurl`

- [gRPC Authentication Guide](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/)

### Documentation Build Strictness

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The documentation build now runs in strict mode with no `warnonly` exceptions.

**Completed**:
- [x] Verified all exported symbols have docstrings (66 exports, all documented)
- [x] Verified no broken cross-references
- [x] Removed `warnonly` from `docs/make.jl`
- [x] Updated `devbranch` to `develop` for Git flow compatibility

## Medium Priority

### Externalize HTTP/2 Module

**Status**: ✅ Complete — Step 1 (feature 019-http2-backend-abstraction) and Step 2 both done

The in-tree `src/http2/` module duplicated code that had been extracted into [PureHTTP2.jl](https://github.com/s-celles/PureHTTP2.jl). Feature 019 removed that duplication and shipped a lightweight backend abstraction so future alternatives like [Nghttp2Wrapper.jl](https://github.com/s-celles/Nghttp2Wrapper.jl) or [HTTP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl) ([JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl#1248](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl/pull/1248)) can plug in without modifying gRPCServer core.

**Completed (Step 1)**:
- [x] Added PureHTTP2.jl as a runtime dependency (URL-based until registration)
- [x] Defined `AbstractHTTP2Backend` / `PureHTTP2Backend` / `create_connection` in `src/http2_backend.jl` — connection-factory pattern, zero per-request overhead
- [x] Added `http2_backend` keyword/field on `GRPCServer`; `handle_connection` dispatches through it
- [x] Deleted `src/http2/` (~3,100 lines: frames.jl, hpack.jl, stream.jl, flow_control.jl, connection.jl)
- [x] Full test suite passes (9336 tests); no benchmark regressions (see `benchmark/BASELINE.md`)
- [x] New `docs/src/http2-backends.md` documenting the backend interface

**Step 2 (done)**:
- [x] Add package extensions once a second backend was validated end-to-end:
  `HTTPjlBackend` (the default, in-tree via the hard `HTTP.jl` dep) and
  `Nghttp2Backend` (`ext/gRPCServerNghttp2Ext.jl`) both implement the raised
  `AbstractGRPCStream`/`serve_grpc` contract
- [x] Three backends ship: `HTTPjlBackend` (default), `PureHTTP2Backend`,
  `Nghttp2Backend`

**Tradeoffs for Step 2:**
- Nghttp2Wrapper: most battle-tested protocol correctness (libnghttp2 is the reference C impl), but adds a binary dependency.
- HTTP.jl #1248: keeps the stack pure-Julia and aligned with JuliaWeb, but blocked on upstream merge.
- HTTP.jl: the default backend — pure-Julia, aligned with JuliaWeb, and already shipping as `HTTPjlBackend`. PureHTTP2: opt-in backend.

- [JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl#1248 — HTTP/2 support](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl/pull/1248)

### Code Coverage Improvements

**Status**: Ongoing

The constitution recommends >80% code coverage for non-generated code.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review current coverage reports
- [ ] Add tests for uncovered error paths
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases in HTTP/2 frame handling

### Performance Benchmarks

**Status**: ✅ Complete

The constitution requires benchmark comparisons for performance-critical changes.

**Completed**:
- [x] Create benchmark suite using BenchmarkTools.jl
- [x] Benchmark request dispatch latency
- [x] Benchmark streaming throughput
- [x] Benchmark message serialization overhead
- [x] Comparison functionality with color-coded output
- [x] Document baseline performance metrics

**Usage**:
```bash
cd benchmark
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
julia --project benchmarks.jl
julia --project benchmarks.jl --save baseline.json
julia --project benchmarks.jl --compare baseline.json
```

## Low Priority

### Additional Contract Tests

**Status**: Partially Complete (grpcurl done)

Expand contract testing beyond grpcurl to other reference gRPC implementations.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test against official Go gRPC client
- [ ] Test against official Python gRPC client
- [ ] Document interoperability matrix

### TTFX (Time-to-First-Execution) Optimization

**Status**: Partially Complete

The constitution recommends TTFX for basic server startup under 5 seconds.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Measure current TTFX
- [ ] Optimize precompilation workload if needed
- [ ] Document TTFX metrics

## To Be Considered

### Publishing Internal Project Artifacts

**Status**: Under Consideration

Consider making internal development artifacts publicly available for transparency and community contribution.

**Options**:
- [ ] Publish project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
- [ ] Publish specs/ directory with design documents
- [ ] Include `.proto` files in repository (currently in `specs/*/contracts/`)
- [ ] Alternative: Download `.proto` files from upstream [grpc/grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) repository at build time

**References**:
- [gRPC Health Checking Protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md)
- [gRPC Server Reflection](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md)

### Security Audit

**Status**: Internal review done; external audit still open

An internal review of the receive and response paths has been completed. It
found and fixed enforcement gaps on the opt-in `PureHTTP2Backend` (an
unenforced receive cap and an uncapped decompressor — a compression bomb), a
response-metadata gap that let a handler append a second `grpc-status`, and
several latent error-path defects. The protections are documented on the
Security Hardening docs page and pinned by `test/security/`.

An external audit would still add value, particularly on the HTTP/2 and TLS
layers, which are largely delegated to dependencies.

- [ ] Apply for free security audit programs (e.g., OSTIF, Linux Foundation)
- [ ] Community security review
- [ ] Fuzzing harnesses for `FrameReader`, HPACK, and decompression
- [ ] A body-size limit in Nghttp2Wrapper, so the receive cap can bound allocation and not just processing on `Nghttp2Backend`
- [ ] Expose the verified mTLS peer identity to handlers (blocked on Reseau)
- [x] Document threat model and security considerations (docs/src/security.md)
- [x] Adversarial test suite (`test/security/`)
- [x] Add security policy (SECURITY.md)

**Areas of concern**:
- HTTP/2 frame parsing and validation
- HPACK decompression (potential for compression bombs)
- TLS configuration defaults
- Input validation on gRPC messages

## Completed

- [x] Core gRPC server implementation
- [x] All four RPC patterns (unary, server/client/bidi streaming)
